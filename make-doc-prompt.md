**Prompt:**

Document everything from the docs. Each page should have its own .md file.

Put all files in: the docs/(name of document)/ folder. You are restricted from adding any docs directly to docs/ without them being in their own folder. If you are unsure what the "name of document" should be, Ask me before proceeding and I'll tell you.

Format the following documentation using a custom multi-level outline style with the following pattern:

- **Level 1:** Number (e.g., `1`) - the page
- **Level 2:** Capital letter (e.g., `A`) - each # header should start with A

Each level should be indented appropriately, and headings should follow this structure:  
`1. A. [Title]`

Apply the correct prefix and indentation based on the heading level. Use consistent spacing and formatting throughout.

The first page should be an intro that explain the subject, has a table of content pointing to each page and
make sure it has a today date to document when the document was created.
