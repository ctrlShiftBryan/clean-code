*Date: November 11, 2023*

1. A. What is Expo Router?

Expo Router is an open-source routing library for Universal React Native applications built with Expo. It provides a file-based routing system that works seamlessly across multiple platforms (Android, iOS, and web), allowing developers to create consistent navigation experiences.

1. B. Key Features

Expo Router offers several powerful features:

- **Native Navigation**: Built on top of React Navigation, providing truly native and platform-optimized navigation by default.
- **Shareable Deep Links**: Every screen automatically becomes deep linkable, making any route in your app shareable.
- **Offline-First**: Apps run offline-first with automatic updates when publishing new versions.
- **Performance Optimized**: Routes use lazy-evaluation in production and deferred bundling in development.
- **Universal Platform Support**: Unified navigation structure across Android, iOS, and web.
- **SEO Friendly**: Enables build-time static rendering on web and universal linking to native apps.
