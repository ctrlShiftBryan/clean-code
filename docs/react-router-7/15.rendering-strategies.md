15. A. Rendering Strategies

This page covers the three main rendering strategies available in React Router 7.

15. B. Introduction

React Router 7 supports three rendering strategies, each with its own benefits and use cases:

- Client Side Rendering (CSR)
- Server Side Rendering (SSR)
- Static Pre-rendering

Understanding these strategies helps you choose the best approach for your application's performance, SEO, and user experience requirements.

15. C. Client Side Rendering

Client Side Rendering (CSR) is the traditional approach for single-page applications (SPAs). With this strategy, routes are rendered in the browser as users navigate through the application.

To configure client-side rendering and explicitly disable server rendering in Framework Mode:

```jsx
// react-router.config.js
import type { Config } from "@react-router/dev/config";

export default {
  ssr: false,
} satisfies Config;
```

Benefits of Client Side Rendering:

- Simpler deployment (static file hosting is sufficient)
- Lower server resource requirements
- Smooth transitions between pages

Drawbacks:

- Slower initial load
- Potential SEO challenges
- Initial blank page while JavaScript loads

15. D. Server Side Rendering

Server Side Rendering (SSR) generates HTML on the server for each request. This provides a complete HTML document to the browser before any JavaScript is loaded or executed.

To enable server-side rendering in Framework Mode:

```jsx
// react-router.config.js
import type { Config } from "@react-router/dev/config";

export default {
  ssr: true,
} satisfies Config;
```

Important considerations for SSR:

- Requires a server environment that supports Node.js or a similar runtime
- Even with global SSR enabled, individual routes can use client data loading with `clientLoader` to avoid server rendering for specific parts of the UI
- SSR improves initial page load times and SEO

Implementation example for Data Mode:

```jsx
// server.js
import express from 'express';
import { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server';
import {
  createStaticHandler,
  createStaticRouter,
  StaticRouterProvider,
} from 'react-router-dom/server';
import { routes } from './routes';

const app = express();

app.get('*', async (req, res) => {
  // Create a request from the URL
  const request = new Request(req.url);

  // Create a static handler for the request
  const handler = createStaticHandler(routes);

  // Process the request
  const context = await handler.query(request);

  // Create a router with the context
  const router = createStaticRouter(routes, context);

  // Render to HTML
  const html = renderToString(<StaticRouterProvider router={router} />);

  // Send the response
  res.send(`
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>React Router App</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <div id="root">${html}</div>
        <script src="/static/js/main.js"></script>
      </body>
    </html>
  `);
});

app.listen(3000);
```

15. E. Static Pre-rendering

Static Pre-rendering generates HTML files at build time rather than at runtime. This approach combines the SEO benefits of server rendering with the deployment simplicity of static sites.

To configure static pre-rendering in Framework Mode:

```jsx
// react-router.config.js
import type { Config } from "@react-router/dev/config";

export default {
  // Return a list of URLs to prerender at build time
  async prerender() {
    return ["/", "/about", "/contact"];
  },
} satisfies Config;
```

Key benefits of Static Pre-rendering:

- Excellent SEO as search engines receive complete HTML
- Fast initial page loads
- Can be hosted on simple static file servers
- Reduced server load compared to SSR

Limitations:

- Content is generated at build time, so dynamic content requires rebuilds
- Not suitable for highly personalized or frequently changing content
- Routes not in the prerender list will be client-rendered

15. F. Hybrid Approaches

React Router 7 allows for hybrid approaches that combine multiple rendering strategies:

1. **Selective SSR**: Use SSR globally but opt specific routes out with `clientLoader`

```jsx
// routes.js
const routes = [
  {
    path: '/',
    element: <Layout />,
    children: [
      {
        path: 'dashboard',
        element: <Dashboard />,
        // This will be rendered on the client, not the server
        clientLoader: () => fetchDashboardData(),
      },
    ],
  },
];
```

2. **Partial Pre-rendering**: Pre-render marketing pages while keeping application pages client-rendered

```jsx
// react-router.config.js
export default {
  ssr: true,
  async prerender() {
    // Only pre-render the marketing pages
    return [
      "/",
      "/about",
      "/pricing",
      "/contact",
    ];
  },
} satisfies Config;
```

15. G. Choosing the Right Strategy

| Strategy              | Best For                                           | Considerations                               |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Client-Side Rendering | Application-heavy sites with authenticated content | Simplest deployment, weakest SEO             |
| Server-Side Rendering | Content-heavy sites with dynamic data              | Best for SEO, requires server infrastructure |
| Static Pre-rendering  | Marketing sites, documentation, blogs              | Best performance, limited to static content  |

When deciding which strategy to use, consider:

- SEO requirements
- Initial load performance needs
- Content update frequency
- Server infrastructure constraints
- Development team familiarity

For most applications, a hybrid approach often provides the best balance of performance, SEO, and development experience.
