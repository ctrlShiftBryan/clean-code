3. A. Core Concepts

This page covers the fundamental concepts that form the foundation of React Router 7.

3. B. Routing Philosophy

React Router 7 adopts a declarative approach to routing, allowing you to define your UI based on the current URL state. This contrasts with imperative routing where you manually manipulate browser history or conditionally render components.

Key philosophical points:

- URLs should be treated as UI, not as an afterthought
- Nested routes reflect nested UI
- Routes are just React components

3. C. Router Objects

In React Router 7, everything starts with a router object, which maintains the current location and handles navigation changes.

```jsx
const router = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: '/',
    element: <Root />,
    children: [
      {
        path: 'dashboard',
        element: <Dashboard />,
      },
    ],
  },
]);
```

The router object:

- Keeps track of history and current location
- Matches URLs to routes
- Renders the appropriate components

3. D. Routes

Routes define the mappings between URL patterns and the components that should be rendered when those patterns match. Routes can be nested to reflect UI hierarchy.

```jsx
createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: '/',
    element: <Layout />,
    children: [
      { index: true, element: <Home /> },
      {
        path: 'users/:userId',
        element: <UserProfile />,
        loader: userLoader,
      },
    ],
  },
]);
```

Route properties include:

- `path` - the URL pattern to match
- `element` - the React component to render
- `loader` - for data fetching before rendering
- `action` - for handling form submissions
- `errorElement` - for error handling
- `children` - for nested routes

3. E. Matches and Rendering

When a URL matches a route pattern, React Router creates a "match" object that includes:

- The route object that matched
- URL parameters extracted from the path
- The matched pathname portion of the URL

The router then renders the matched route's element, passing routing context and URL parameters.

3. F. Location

The location represents where the app is now, where it was, and where it's going. It's an object that contains:

- `pathname` - the path portion of the URL
- `search` - the query string portion
- `hash` - the anchor portion
- `state` - hidden state preserved by the router

Location objects are immutable, and changes to the location trigger re-renders throughout the application.
