# Alerting and Detection

Elastic Observability provides powerful alerting and detection capabilities that allow you to proactively identify issues, anomalies, and potential problems across your entire technology stack.

## Overview

Elastic alerting enables you to:

- Create alerts based on thresholds, patterns, or anomalies
- Monitor metrics, logs, availability, and security events
- Define complex multi-condition alert rules
- Coordinate notification and response workflows
- Reduce alert fatigue with proper tuning
- Track alert history and resolution

## Alert Types

### Threshold Alerts

Trigger notifications based on specific metric values:

- **Metric Threshold**: Alert when metrics cross defined thresholds
- **Log Threshold**: Alert when log event count matches criteria
- **Inventory Threshold**: Alert based on host or container counts
- **Uptime Threshold**: Alert on availability metrics

### Anomaly Detection

Machine learning powered anomaly detection:

- **Metric Anomalies**: Detect unusual patterns in metric data
- **Log Anomalies**: Identify abnormal log patterns or frequencies
- **Uptime Anomalies**: Detect irregular availability patterns
- **APM Transaction Anomalies**: Find unusual application performance

### Rule-Based Alerts

Sophisticated condition-based alerting:

- **Query-Based**: Alert on specific data patterns in any index
- **Composite Conditions**: Combine multiple factors into single alerts
- **Frequency-Based**: Alert when events occur at unusual frequencies
- **Correlation Rules**: Connect multiple data types in single rules

## Creating Alerts

### Basic Alert Creation

1. In Kibana, navigate to **Management → Alerts and Insights → Rules**
2. Click **Create rule**
3. Select the rule type (e.g., "Metric threshold")
4. Define the alert conditions:

```yaml
# Example metric threshold alert
rule_name: 'High CPU Usage'
metrics:
  - metric: system.cpu.user.pct
    threshold: 90
    comparator: >
    timeSize: 5
    timeUnit: m
    aggType: avg
filters:
  - field: host.name
    value: production-*
```

5. Configure the alert actions (notifications)
6. Set alert tags and metadata
7. Review and save the rule

### Advanced Alert Configuration

For complex scenarios, use KQL (Kibana Query Language) or Elasticsearch Query DSL:

```yaml
# Complex query-based alert
rule_name: 'Failed Login Attempts'
index_pattern: 'logs-*'
query: 'event.category:"authentication" and event.outcome:"failure" and user.name:"admin"'
threshold:
  value: 5
  comparator: '>'
  timeSize: 5
  timeUnit: 'm'
groupBy: 'source.ip'
```

## Alert Actions

### Notification Channels

Send alert notifications through multiple channels:

- Email (individual or group)
- Slack and Microsoft Teams
- Webhook integrations
- PagerDuty, ServiceNow, and ITSM tools
- Custom actions via Elasticsearch or external APIs

### Action Configuration

1. In Kibana, navigate to **Management → Alerts and Insights → Connectors**
2. Click **Create connector**
3. Select the connector type (e.g., "Slack")
4. Configure the connector details:

```yaml
# Example Slack connector
name: 'Production Alerts'
slack_url: 'https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
```

5. Test the connector
6. Save the configuration

### Alert Message Templates

Customize notification content with variables and context:

```
[{{rule.name}}] Alert triggered at {{context.date}}

Condition: {{context.conditions}}
Value: {{context.value}} (Threshold: {{context.threshold}})
Host: {{context.host}}

View in Kibana: {{{context.kibanaURL}}}
```

## Alert Management

### Alert Status and Lifecycle

Track and manage alert instances:

- **Active**: Currently firing alerts
- **Recovered**: Previously triggered alerts that resolved
- **Acknowledged**: Alerts marked as seen by operators
- **Snoozed**: Temporarily suppressed alerts

### Alert Grouping

Reduce noise by grouping related alerts:

- Group by host, container, or service
- Deduplicate similar alerts
- Create parent/child alert relationships
- Implement alert severity levels

### Maintenance Windows

Suppress alerts during planned maintenance:

1. Navigate to **Management → Alerts and Insights → Maintenance Windows**
2. Click **Create maintenance window**
3. Define the time period and affected systems
4. Select which alert rules to suppress
5. Save the maintenance window

## Advanced Detection Features

### Machine Learning Jobs

Create specialized ML jobs for advanced detection:

1. Navigate to **Machine Learning → Anomaly Detection**
2. Click **Create job**
3. Select a job type (single metric, multi-metric, population, etc.)
4. Define the data source and analysis parameters
5. Configure job schedules and alerts

### Correlation Rules

Connect multiple data types for holistic detection:

1. Create rule with **Threshold** and **Machine Learning** conditions
2. Define how conditions relate (AND/OR logic)
3. Set separate thresholds for each condition
4. Configure combined alerting behavior

### Outlier Detection

Identify anomalous entities using outlier analysis:

1. Navigate to **Machine Learning → Anomaly Detection**
2. Create an outlier detection job
3. Select the entity field (e.g., `host.name`, `container.id`)
4. Choose the metrics to analyze
5. Set outlier thresholds and detection parameters

## Best Practices

### Alert Design

- Focus on actionable alerts that require human intervention
- Define clear ownership for each alert type
- Include sufficient context for troubleshooting
- Link to relevant dashboards and documentation
- Use appropriate severity levels

### Reducing Alert Fatigue

- Implement proper thresholds based on baseline analysis
- Use anomaly detection for dynamic environments
- Group related alerts to reduce noise
- Implement alert suppression for known issues
- Review and tune alerts regularly

### Escalation Paths

- Define clear escalation procedures
- Configure tiered alert routing
- Implement on-call rotations
- Set auto-escalation for critical alerts
- Track alert response times

### Validation and Testing

- Test alerts in non-production environments
- Validate alert triggers with synthetic events
- Simulate failure conditions to verify alerts
- Document expected alert behavior
- Conduct regular alert review sessions

## Troubleshooting Alerts

Common issues and solutions:

- **Missing alerts**: Check rule status and execution logs
- **Too many alerts**: Adjust thresholds or implement grouping
- **Delayed alerts**: Check execution frequency and system load
- **Failed actions**: Verify connector configurations and permissions

## Next Steps

- Integrate alerts with your [incident management](./incident-management.md) process
- Combine alerts with [automated remediation](./automated-remediation.md)
- Set up [executive dashboards](./dashboards.md) for alert trends
- Implement [alert correlation](./alert-correlation.md) across data sources
