# 2. Installation and Setup

## 2. A. Prerequisites

Before setting up EAS Build, ensure you have the following:

- An Expo account (create one at [expo.dev/signup](https://expo.dev/signup))
- A React Native or Expo project
- Node.js installed (version 14 or higher recommended)
- Git installed

## 2. B. Installing EAS CLI

EAS Build is managed through the EAS CLI (Command Line Interface). Install it globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g eas-cli
```

You can verify the installation by checking the version:

```bash
eas --version
```

## 2. C. Logging in to Expo

To use EAS Build, you need to authenticate with your Expo account:

```bash
eas login
```

You'll be prompted to enter your Expo username and password. You can verify you're logged in correctly with:

```bash
eas whoami
```

## 2. D. Initializing EAS in Your Project

Navigate to your project directory and initialize EAS:

```bash
cd your-project-directory
eas init
```

This command links your local project to an Expo project and creates an initial `eas.json` configuration file in your project root.

## 2. E. Configuring Your Project for EAS Build

Run the following command to set up your project for EAS Build:

```bash
eas build:configure
```

This command:

- Creates or updates your `eas.json` file with default build profiles
- Ensures your native projects are properly configured
- Sets up app signing configuration

When prompted, select the platforms you want to build for (Android, iOS, or both).

## 2. F. Setting Up Platform-Specific Requirements

### 2. F. 1. iOS Requirements

For iOS builds, you'll need:

- An Apple Developer account ($99/year)
- App Store Connect setup for your app
- App signing credentials (EAS can manage these for you)

### 2. F. 2. Android Requirements

For Android builds, you'll need:

- A Google Play Developer account ($25 one-time fee) if you plan to publish to Google Play
- Keystore for signing your app (EAS can generate and manage this for you)

## 2. G. Verifying Your Setup

You can verify your EAS setup with:

```bash
eas diagnostics
```

This command checks your configuration and reports any issues that might prevent successful builds.

## 2. H. Next Steps

After installation and setup, you're ready to:

1. Configure build profiles in `eas.json`
2. Run your first build
3. Set up internal distribution for testing

Refer to the [Build Configuration](4.build-configuration.md) and [Build Profiles](5.build-profiles.md) sections for details on customizing your builds.
