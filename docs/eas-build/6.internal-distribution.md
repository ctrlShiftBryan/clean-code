# 6. Internal Distribution

## 6. A. What is Internal Distribution?

Internal distribution is an EAS Build feature that allows you to share your app builds directly with testers without going through app stores. This is particularly useful for:

- Testing app versions before app store submission
- Sharing builds with stakeholders for review
- Distributing enterprise apps within an organization
- Quick iteration during development

## 6. B. Setting Up Internal Distribution

To configure a build for internal distribution, set the `distribution` property to `internal` in your build profile:

```json
{
  "build": {
    "preview": {
      "distribution": "internal",
      "android": {
        "buildType": "apk"
      },
      "ios": {
        "simulator": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 6. C. Creating Internal Distribution Builds

To create an internal distribution build, run:

```bash
eas build --profile preview --platform all
```

## 6. D. Android Internal Distribution

### 6. D. 1. Android Build Types

For Android internal distribution, your build type should be set to `apk`:

```json
{
  "android": {
    "buildType": "apk"
  }
}
```

APK files can be installed directly on Android devices, unlike AAB (Android App Bundle) files which are designed for Google Play distribution.

### 6. D. 2. Installing Android Builds

After your build completes, EAS provides:

1. A QR code that can be scanned to download the APK
2. A direct download link to the APK
3. Installation instructions for testers

Android users need to enable "Install from unknown sources" in their device settings to install internal distribution builds.

## 6. E. iOS Internal Distribution

### 6. E. 1. iOS Provisioning Types

For iOS internal distribution, you have two options:

1. **Ad Hoc Provisioning**:

   - Requires registering device UDIDs
   - Limited to 100 devices per Apple Developer account
   - Best for small teams

2. **Enterprise Provisioning** (requires Apple Developer Enterprise Program):
   - No need to register individual devices
   - Can be distributed to any number of devices within your organization
   - Requires an Enterprise Apple Developer account ($299/year)

Configure enterprise provisioning in your build profile:

```json
{
  "ios": {
    "enterpriseProvisioning": "universal"
  }
}
```

### 6. E. 2. Device Registration

To register devices for ad hoc distribution:

```bash
eas device:create
```

This will guide you through the process of registering device UDIDs. You can also list registered devices:

```bash
eas device:list
```

### 6. E. 3. Installing iOS Builds

For iOS builds, EAS provides:

1. A QR code for installation
2. A direct download link for the IPA
3. Installation instructions for testers

iOS users need to trust the enterprise certificate on their device before installation.

## 6. F. Sharing Builds with Testers

### 6. F. 1. Sharing via Email or Messaging

After a build completes, you'll get a shareable URL from EAS. You can:

- Copy the URL directly from the terminal output
- View it on the EAS website
- Get it from the build details page

Example command to get a build URL:

```bash
eas build:list
```

Then select the build to see its details including the URL.

### 6. F. 2. Using QR Codes

Each internal build comes with a QR code that testers can scan to download the app:

- Android users can scan and download directly
- iOS users will be directed to install a provisioning profile first, then the app

## 6. G. Managing Tester Devices

### 6. G. 1. Adding New Devices

To add a new iOS device for testing:

```bash
eas device:create
```

Follow the prompts to register the device's UDID.

### 6. G. 2. Removing Devices

To remove a device:

```bash
eas device:delete
```

### 6. G. 3. Viewing Registered Devices

List all registered devices:

```bash
eas device:list
```

## 6. H. Build Expiration

Internal distribution builds have the following expiration policies:

- **Android APKs**: No expiration
- **iOS Ad Hoc**: Valid for 1 year from provisioning profile creation
- **iOS Enterprise**: Valid for 1 year from provisioning profile creation

## 6. I. Advanced Internal Distribution Features

### 6. I. 1. Custom Installation Instructions

You can customize the installation page that testers see by providing custom instructions in your project's app.json/app.config.js:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "extra": {
      "eas": {
        "projectId": "your-project-id",
        "internalDistribution": {
          "installationInstructions": "Custom instructions for installing the app"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 6. I. 2. Restricting Access to Builds

You can restrict access to your internal distribution builds by using EAS's access control features:

1. Create an account in your organization for the tester
2. Add the account to your project with the appropriate permissions
3. The tester will need to log in to download the build

### 6. I. 3. Build Artifacts

In addition to the installable app, you can specify additional build artifacts to be included with your internal distribution:

```json
{
  "build": {
    "preview": {
      "buildArtifactPaths": [
        "android/app/build/outputs/mapping/release/mapping.txt"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## 6. J. Best Practices for Internal Distribution

1. **Create a dedicated build profile** for internal testing
2. **Use descriptive build message** to identify build purpose
3. **Register tester devices in advance** for iOS ad hoc distribution
4. **Consider enterprise provisioning** for larger organizations
5. **Document installation instructions** for non-technical testers
6. **Keep builds organized** by using clear naming and versioning
7. **Automate build distribution** with CI/CD integration
