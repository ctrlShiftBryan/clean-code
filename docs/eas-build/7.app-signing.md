# 7. App Signing

## 7. A. Understanding App Signing

App signing is the process of digitally signing your application packages (APKs, AABs, IPAs) to verify their authenticity and integrity. Signing is required by both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, and it ensures that:

- The app comes from a known, verified developer
- The app hasn't been tampered with since it was signed
- Updates to the app come from the same developer

EAS Build streamlines the app signing process by managing your signing credentials securely in the cloud.

## 7. B. Android App Signing

### 7. B. 1. Android Signing Credentials

Android apps are signed using a keystore file, which contains:

- A private key for signing the app
- A certificate that links the app to your identity

Once an app is published with a specific keystore, all future updates must be signed with the same keystore. If you lose your keystore, you won't be able to update your app, and you'll need to publish a new app with a new package name.

### 7. B. 2. Managing Android Keystores with EAS

EAS offers three approaches to managing Android keystores:

1. **Let EAS generate and manage your keystore** (recommended):

   ```bash
   eas build --platform android
   ```

   When prompted, select "Generate new keystore".

2. **Use your existing keystore from Expo Classic builds**:

   ```bash
   eas build --platform android
   ```

   When prompted, select "I have used the Classic build system before".

3. **Use your own keystore**:
   ```bash
   eas build --platform android
   ```
   When prompted, select "I want to upload my own keystore".

### 7. B. 3. Google Play App Signing

Google Play offers App Signing, which adds an extra layer of security. With Google Play App Signing:

1. You upload your app signed with an **upload key**
2. Google Play re-signs the app with the **app signing key**
3. Users download the app signed with Google's app signing key

To set up Google Play App Signing with EAS:

1. Generate an upload keystore:
   ```bash
   eas credentials
   ```
2. Select "Android", then "Upload Keystore"

3. Submit your first build to Google Play using this upload keystore

4. Google Play will generate an app signing key for your app

## 7. C. iOS App Signing

### 7. C. 1. iOS Signing Credentials

iOS app signing is more complex and requires several components:

1. **Distribution Certificate**: Identifies you as a developer
2. **Provisioning Profile**: Maps your app ID to:
   - Your certificate
   - Allowed devices (for ad hoc distribution)
   - Entitlements (app capabilities like push notifications)

### 7. C. 2. Managing iOS Credentials with EAS

EAS offers several options for managing iOS credentials:

1. **Let EAS manage credentials** (recommended):

   ```bash
   eas build --platform ios
   ```

   When prompted, sign in with your Apple Developer account.

2. **Use existing credentials from Expo Classic builds**:

   ```bash
   eas build --platform ios
   ```

   When prompted, select "I have used the Classic build system before".

3. **Use your own credentials**:
   ```bash
   eas build --platform ios
   ```
   When prompted, select "I want to upload my own credentials".

### 7. C. 3. iOS Provisioning Profile Types

EAS supports different provisioning profile types:

1. **Development**: For development builds and debugging
2. **Ad Hoc**: For internal distribution to registered devices
3. **App Store**: For App Store distribution
4. **Enterprise**: For in-house distribution (requires Apple Developer Enterprise Program)

## 7. D. Credential Management Commands

EAS CLI provides several commands for managing credentials:

### 7. D. 1. Viewing Credentials

```bash
eas credentials
```

### 7. D. 2. Creating New Credentials

```bash
eas credentials
```

Then select the platform and follow the interactive prompts.

### 7. D. 3. Managing iOS Credentials

```bash
# View iOS credentials
eas credentials --platform ios

# Create a new distribution certificate
eas credentials --platform ios --action create-distribution-certificate

# Create a new provisioning profile
eas credentials --platform ios --action create-provisioning-profile
```

### 7. D. 4. Managing Android Credentials

```bash
# View Android credentials
eas credentials --platform android

# Create a new keystore
eas credentials --platform android --action create-keystore
```

## 7. E. Build Profile Credentials Configuration

You can control how credentials are used in your build profiles:

```json
{
  "build": {
    "production": {
      "credentialsSource": "remote"
    },
    "development": {
      "credentialsSource": "local",
      "ios": {
        "simulator": true
      },
      "android": {
        "withoutCredentials": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- `credentialsSource: "remote"`: Use credentials managed by EAS
- `credentialsSource: "local"`: Use local credentials from credentials.json
- `withoutCredentials: true`: Skip signing (useful for development builds)

## 7. F. Local Credentials

If you prefer to manage credentials locally, you can store them in a credentials.json file:

```json
{
  "android": {
    "keystore": {
      "keystorePath": "path/to/keystore.jks",
      "keystorePassword": "keystore_password",
      "keyAlias": "key_alias",
      "keyPassword": "key_password"
    }
  },
  "ios": {
    "provisioningProfilePath": "path/to/profile.mobileprovision",
    "distributionCertificate": {
      "path": "path/to/certificate.p12",
      "password": "certificate_password"
    }
  }
}
```

Ensure this file is not committed to version control for security.

## 7. G. Best Practices for App Signing

1. **Let EAS manage your credentials** when possible
2. **Backup your keystores** if you manage them yourself
3. **Keep passwords secure** and do not store them in version control
4. **Configure CI/CD properly** to handle credentials securely
5. **Use Google Play App Signing** for added security on Android
6. **Document your signing strategy** for team knowledge sharing

## 7. H. Troubleshooting App Signing Issues

### 7. H. 1. Common Android Issues

- **Keystore mismatch**: Ensure you're using the same keystore for updates
- **Incorrect passwords**: Double-check keystore and key passwords
- **Missing keystore**: Ensure your keystore file is accessible

### 7. H. 2. Common iOS Issues

- **Certificate expiration**: Distribution certificates expire after one year
- **Provisioning profile issues**: Ensure the profile includes the correct bundle ID and devices
- **Apple Developer Program membership**: Verify your membership is active
