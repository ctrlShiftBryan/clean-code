# 10. EAS Update Integration

## 10. A. Understanding EAS Update

EAS Update is a service that allows you to push updates to your app's JavaScript code and assets without requiring a full rebuild or app store submission. This enables you to:

- Fix bugs quickly
- Update content and styling
- Add new features (that don't require native code changes)
- A/B test features
- Roll out changes gradually

EAS Update works hand-in-hand with EAS Build to provide a comprehensive deployment solution for your React Native and Expo applications.

## 10. B. How EAS Update Works

EAS Update operates on a simple model:

1. **Builds** have a fixed native code layer that defines which JS code can run
2. **Updates** provide the JS code and assets that run on a compatible native layer
3. **Channels** connect builds to updates, allowing you to target specific groups of users

The compatibility between builds and updates is determined by:

- **Platform**: iOS or Android
- **Runtime Version**: Defines the JS-native interface version
- **Channel**: Links builds to updates

## 10. C. Configuring EAS Update

### 10. C. 1. Install Required Dependencies

Ensure you have the `expo-updates` package installed:

```bash
npx expo install expo-updates
```

### 10. C. 2. Configure update functionality

Run the following command to set up EAS Update in your project:

```bash
eas update:configure
```

This command will:

- Add runtime version to your app configuration
- Configure updates.url in your app configuration
- Set up update channels in eas.json

### 10. C. 3. Update your eas.json

In your `eas.json` file, add a `channel` property to each build profile:

```json
{
  "build": {
    "development": {
      "developmentClient": true,
      "distribution": "internal",
      "channel": "development"
    },
    "preview": {
      "distribution": "internal",
      "channel": "preview"
    },
    "production": {
      "distribution": "store",
      "channel": "production"
    }
  }
}
```

The `channel` property specifies which update branch will be used for each build. When you publish an update to a channel, builds configured with that channel will receive the update.

## 10. D. Creating Builds for EAS Update

To create a build that can receive updates, run:

```bash
eas build --profile production --platform all
```

This will create a build with the specified channel (in this case, "production").

Important properties that affect updates:

1. **Runtime Version**: Determined by app.json/app.config.js `runtimeVersion`
2. **Channel**: Set in eas.json build profile
3. **Platform**: iOS or Android

## 10. E. Publishing Updates

### 10. E. 1. Basic Update Publishing

After making changes to your app, publish an update:

```bash
eas update --channel production --message "Fix login bug"
```

This command:

1. Bundles your JS code and assets
2. Uploads the bundle to EAS servers
3. Makes it available to builds configured with the specified channel

### 10. E. 2. Auto Mode

You can use auto mode to automatically create an update with the current Git branch name and commit message:

```bash
eas update --auto
```

### 10. E. 3. Platform-Specific Updates

Publish an update for a specific platform:

```bash
eas update --channel production --platform android --message "Android-specific fix"
```

## 10. F. Managing Branches and Channels

### 10. F. 1. Creating Branches

Branches contain updates with the same runtime version.

You can create a branch:

```bash
eas branch:create my-feature
```

### 10. F. 2. Linking Channels to Branches

By default, a channel links to a branch with the same name. You can change this:

```bash
eas channel:edit production --branch stable-v1
```

This will make the "production" channel point to the "stable-v1" branch.

### 10. F. 3. Testing Branch Changes

This pattern is useful for testing:

1. Create a build with channel "production"
2. Publish updates to branch "staging"
3. Test updates on the staging branch
4. When ready, point the production channel to the staging branch:

```bash
eas channel:edit production --branch staging
```

Users with the production build will now receive updates from the staging branch.

## 10. G. Rollout Strategies

### 10. G. 1. Phased Rollouts

Roll out updates gradually to a percentage of users:

```bash
eas update --channel production --message "Gradual feature rollout" --rollout-percentage 20
```

This releases the update to 20% of users initially. You can later increase the percentage:

```bash
eas update:edit --rollout-percentage 50
```

And eventually to 100%:

```bash
eas update:edit --rollout-percentage 100
```

### 10. G. 2. Branch-Based Rollouts

For more complex rollouts, use the channel rollout feature:

```bash
eas channel:rollout production --action create --branch new-feature --percent 25
```

This creates a rollout of the "new-feature" branch to 25% of users on the "production" channel.

## 10. H. Handling Update Failures

### 10. H. 1. Republishing Previous Updates

If an update causes issues, you can republish a previous update:

```bash
eas update:republish --channel production --group [UPDATE-GROUP-ID]
```

Replace `[UPDATE-GROUP-ID]` with the ID of a previously published update group.

### 10. H. 2. Rolling Back to Embedded Version

In emergency situations, roll back to the version embedded in the build:

```bash
eas update:roll-back-to-embedded --channel production
```

## 10. I. Update Automation

### 10. I. 1. GitHub Actions Integration

Automate update publishing with GitHub Actions:

```yaml
name: Publish Update
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18.x
          cache: npm

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Setup EAS
        uses: expo/expo-github-action@v8
        with:
          eas-version: latest
          token: ${{ secrets.EXPO_TOKEN }}

      - name: Publish update
        run: eas update --auto
```

### 10. I. 2. Branch-Based Publishing

You can set up different branches to publish to different channels:

```yaml
name: EAS Update
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - develop

jobs:
  update:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # ... setup steps
      - name: Determine channel
        id: channel
        run: |
          if [[ $GITHUB_REF == refs/heads/main ]]; then
            echo "channel=production" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          else
            echo "channel=preview" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          fi

      - name: Publish update
        run: eas update --channel ${{ steps.channel.outputs.channel }} --message "${{ github.event.head_commit.message }}"
```

## 10. J. Best Practices for EAS Update

1. **Keep runtime versions consistent**: Only change the runtime version when making native code changes
2. **Use semantic version patterns**: Consider using semantic versioning like "1.0.0" for your runtime versions
3. **Establish a branch strategy**: Use branches for feature development and testing
4. **Test updates thoroughly**: Always test updates before deploying to production
5. **Use descriptive update messages**: Include meaningful information in update messages
6. **Implement gradual rollouts**: Use phased rollouts for high-risk updates
7. **Monitor update adoption**: Watch for unusual patterns in update downloads
8. **Maintain rollback capability**: Always have a plan to roll back problematic updates
9. **Document your update strategy**: Ensure your team understands the update workflow
