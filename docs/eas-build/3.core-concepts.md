# 3. Core Concepts

## 3. A. Build Architecture

EAS Build operates as a cloud-based build service with the following key components:

1. **Build Servers**: Specialized virtual machines in the cloud that compile your application code
2. **Queue System**: Manages build requests and prioritization based on your EAS plan
3. **Artifact Storage**: Securely stores your build outputs (APKs, AABs, IPAs)
4. **Credential Management**: Securely stores and applies your signing credentials

When you trigger a build, your project code is uploaded to the build servers, compiled according to your configuration, and the resulting artifacts are made available for download or distribution.

## 3. B. Build Profiles

Build profiles are configurations defined in your project's `eas.json` file that determine how your app is built. Each profile can specify:

- Platform-specific settings (Android/iOS)
- Build type (development, preview, production)
- Distribution method (store or internal)
- Environment variables and configuration
- Resource requirements

Example profile in `eas.json`:

```json
{
  "build": {
    "production": {
      "distribution": "store",
      "android": {
        "buildType": "app-bundle"
      },
      "ios": {
        "buildConfiguration": "Release"
      }
    },
    "preview": {
      "distribution": "internal",
      "android": {
        "buildType": "apk"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 3. C. Build Types

EAS Build supports different build types for various purposes:

1. **Development Builds**:

   - Include development tools
   - Enable connecting to local development servers
   - Support hot reloading and debugging

2. **Preview Builds**:

   - Configured for internal distribution
   - Often used for testing before production
   - Can be distributed to testers without app store reviews

3. **Production Builds**:
   - Optimized for performance
   - Ready for store submission
   - Typically include release configuration

## 3. D. Distribution Methods

EAS Build supports two main distribution methods:

1. **Store Distribution**:

   - Builds are configured for submission to app stores
   - Includes proper signing for App Store/Play Store
   - Can be automatically submitted with EAS Submit

2. **Internal Distribution**:
   - Builds can be shared directly with testers
   - No app store review process required
   - Easily shared via QR codes or links
   - Supports ad-hoc and enterprise provisioning for iOS

## 3. E. Build Process

The EAS Build process follows these steps:

1. **Project Preparation**:

   - Your code is uploaded to the build server
   - Dependencies are installed
   - Native projects are configured

2. **Build Execution**:

   - Native build tools (Xcode, Gradle) are executed
   - Project is compiled according to profile settings
   - Application is packaged (IPA, APK, AAB)

3. **Post-Build Processing**:
   - Build artifacts are signed with credentials
   - Output is stored and made available for download
   - Optional automated submission to app stores

## 3. F. Versioning

EAS Build has built-in support for versioning your app:

1. **Auto-Increment**: Automatically increment build numbers or version codes
2. **Version Sync**: Synchronize versions between your app config and native projects
3. **Version Management**: Track and retrieve version history

## 3. G. Resource Classes

EAS Build offers different resource classes that determine the hardware specifications of the build machines:

1. **Default**: Standard resources suitable for most projects
2. **Medium**: Increased memory and CPU for larger projects
3. **Large**: Maximum available resources for complex builds (available on paid plans)

## 3. H. Build Queue and Concurrency

Builds are processed through a queue system:

1. **Queue Position**: Determined by your plan tier and current service load
2. **Concurrency**: Number of simultaneous builds allowed (varies by plan)
3. **Priority**: Paid plans receive priority in the build queue
