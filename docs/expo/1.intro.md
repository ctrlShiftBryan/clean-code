## 1. A. What is Expo?

Expo is a framework and platform for universal React applications. It is a set of tools and services built around React Native and native platforms that help you develop, build, deploy, and quickly iterate on iOS, Android, and web apps from the same JavaScript/TypeScript codebase.

Expo aims to simplify the development process by providing:

- A consistent development environment
- Access to native device capabilities
- Build services for creating native binaries
- Deployment tools for sharing and publishing apps
- Pre-built UI components and libraries

## 1. B. Who is Expo for?

Expo is designed for:

- React and React Native developers
- Cross-platform mobile and web app creators
- Teams looking to streamline their development process
- Developers who want to avoid complex native build configurations
- Anyone looking to create and deploy apps quickly
